//JQuery Challenge:

//You will make a simple jQuery List Application that will take user input and append it to the DOM. 
//Feel free to make it your own. Some examples are:

//- Favorite Bands, Superheroes, etc.
//- Shopping List
//- Ron Swanson Quotes

//Added challenge:
//1. Take multiple user inputs
//2. Add a delete button (for each item or a delete all)
//3. Style it with CSS and/or Bootstrap

    $function(){
$("text" ).append(document.createTextNode( "" ) );
    // ev means event click
    });
